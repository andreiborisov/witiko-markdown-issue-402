# MWE for [Witiko/markdown issue 402](https://github.com/Witiko/markdown/issues/402)

I've uploaded the built image on Docker Hub for your convinience, but feel free to build it locally if you want (I've included the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)).

Run with:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

You can check the input and output files in [`compile`](compile) folder.

Compiling without use of markdown package runs without any issues.

🙏🏻 Thank you in advance!
